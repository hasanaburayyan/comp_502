# About Me

## Intro
My name is Hasan Abu-Rayyan, I am an Ohio native. I have been happily married to my wonderful with since May 2013. We have 3 children, 2 girls 1 boy. In my professional life I am Software Engineer at Chemical Abstract Services
here in Columbus. I work on an application team as the lead DevSecOps Engineer, where my current focus is migrating products from our private cloud to a public AWS solution. Those who know me (hopefully if you are reading this you will be one soon), know that
I have a passion for Computer Science. There are just soo many amazing topics to discuss in this vast and diverse field, and I like most firmly believe that learning to program is one of the most valuable skills you can develop.

## My Tips:
1. Don't Procrastinate
    1. Programming can be very challenging at times, and might require stepping away, going for a walk, distracting yourself, etc. You want to make sure you have plenty of time to do stress relieve.
2. The Rubber Duck is REAL
    1. Sometimes just trying to explain the problem to others, gives you a perspective on the problem you had not thought of yet.
3. When in doubt Debug, Debug, Debug
    1. learning to use a debugger and step through code is invaluable. It can be nearly impossible to keep track of every variable in your hear, so do not hesitate to just step through your code line by line.
4. Read through the code at a high level
    1. Start by maybe just reading the Class names, then read the class names and their function names. You may find it overwhelming to start digging into the logic of every function as you first read through an assingment
5. There are many ways to solve every problem. Try not to focus on what the BEST solution is, iterate and make it better.
    1. How can I print out "Bash-is'nt-scary-it-makes-me-stronger" in a BASH shell? Below we can see two solutions to the same problem. Solution one is LARGE and scary with MANY MANY additional steps that are not needed. Solution two is a quick
       and concise way to accomplish the task. The point here is we may not always see the forest through the trees, sometimes the simple solution may not seem obvious. Focus on getting your code to work, then come back and make it better!
        1. <code>echo "BASH-is-scary-it-makes-me-nervous" \
           | sed "s/-.s-/-is'nt-/" \
           | awk -F"-" '{\$NF=""; print \$0}' \
           | awk '{print \$0 "str"}' \
           | perl -pe 's/(st.)/\$1ong/' > f \
           && M=\$(cat f) && echo "\${M}er"</code>
        2. <code>echo "BASH-is'nt-scary-it-makes-me-stronger"</code>
